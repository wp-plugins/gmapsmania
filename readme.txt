== Description ==

This plugin allows you to directly embed Gmaps code in your posts or pages using the [gmap] shortcode. 

HOW TO USE IT:
When you are in the Write Post or Write Page screen, find the "Custom Fields" area.
If isn't already there, add a custom field named exactly "gmap" (without quotes) and copy and paste 
in the value field the whole code you obtained from Google Maps.
Write anywhere in your post or page the "shortcode" [gmap]: when displayed on the blog it will be 
repalced with your Google Map.
Save and publish. You are done!
